This file explains how to add the banner image displayed in the README.

Steps:
1. Save the attached banner image (from your message) into this repository at: docs/banner.png
   - On Windows, you can right-click the image and "Save as" and choose this path.
2. Commit the file to git:
   git add docs/banner.png
   git commit -m "Add README banner"
   git push origin <your-branch>

Note: Large binary files may need to be tracked with Git LFS if your repository restricts large files. The README references `docs/banner.png` with a width of 900px; you can adjust the width in the README if needed.
